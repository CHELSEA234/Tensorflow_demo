# Tensorflow_demo
Self-study Tensorflow

This repository contains basis of tensorflow and some implementations of deep learning techniques (ex: CNN, GAN, cGAN) that are done via tensorflow as the backend. 

The purpose of this repository is for recording my personal code, many contents rely on other github's contributions that I cannot list them all.
