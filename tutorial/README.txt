This is online tutorial for tensor_flow, here is for sample review purpose

recurrent_network.py is to classify image using RNN
recurrent_network_demo.py is demo I made to understand how data flows through network, and how_to_show_variable.py and how_to_show_shape.py are auxiliary files.

bi-direction-rnn.py is to classify images by using bi-RNN, the different is to using rnn.static_bidirectional_rnn.py and rnn.static_rnn.py

dynamic_rnn.py performs dynamic computation over sequences with variable length, here to add indexing mechanism into Model structure

multigpu_basics:
multigpu_CNN: not very clear here. How to calculate the gradient descent here?
